206. Reverse Linked List
 def reverseList(self, head):
        curr = head
        prev = None
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
Time: O(n)
Explanation: Iterate through the linked list once, flipping the arrows so everything points backwards.

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1, list2):
        curr = head = ListNode()
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
               curr.next = list1
               list1 = list1.next
            else:
                curr.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            curr = curr.next
        curr.next = list1 or list2
        return head.next
Time: O(n)
Explanation: Keep track of pointers in both lists and iterate by choosing the smallest val

141. Linked List Cycle
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        while head:
            print(head.val)
            if head.val == 'hi':
                return True
            else:
                head.val = 'hi'
                head = head.next
        return False 
Time: O(n)
Explanation: Each time we visit a node, change the val to hi. If we see a hi again we know theres a cycle
