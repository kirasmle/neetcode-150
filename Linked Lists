206. Reverse Linked List
 def reverseList(self, head):
        curr = head
        prev = None
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
Time: O(n)
Explanation: Iterate through the linked list once, flipping the arrows so everything points backwards.
