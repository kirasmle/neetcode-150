121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        buy = 0
        profit = 0
        minbuy = prices[buy]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            minbuy = min(minbuy, prices[buy])
            profit = max(profit, prices[i] - minbuy)
            buy += 1
        return profit
Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: Iterating through the array starting at the first element, keep track of the minimum buy value with i being the current sell value. Keep the max profit.
